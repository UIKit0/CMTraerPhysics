Traer Physics Engine for Objective-C
====================================

Traer Physics is a particle system and spring physics simulator.
The library handles the physics simulation only, it is up to the
user to implement any graphical output.

This is a port of the Traer Physics engine to Objective-C, specifically
for use in Cocoa and Cocoa Touch applications (Mac OS X and iOS).

Traer Physics was created by Jeffrey Traer Bernstein

Parts of this project were ported from the AS3 port of Traer Physics
by Arnaud Icard, http://blog.sqrtof5.com

This Objective-C port of Traer Physics is open source and released
under an MIT license.

A demo iOS application is included and shows various ways of how the
physics engine can be used.  The demo app shows example implementations
with both OpenGL ES and Core Animation. The demo app is open source and
released under an MIT license.
